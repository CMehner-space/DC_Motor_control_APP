# DC_Motor_control_APP

App connects to DFRobot Beetle ESP32 microcontoller (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1798.html) via BLE. The microcontroller is connected to Sparkfun DC motor driver (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15451) and two 3-6V DC motors.

- use case for micro- and millifluidics movement of different solutions. 

Button control allows for individual motor forward and backward movement and stop.
Four additional buttons can be preprogrammed for specific motor patterns.

Additional attachment is a RBG LED light strip (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18354) providing any needed alumination with on off function.
